This is the READ ME file for the Google Mock-up Page Project from Week 3 of Wyncode Academy.

This page is supposed to be a replica of a modern Google search page. It is not meant to be fully functional but rather give students a chance to learn to code with HTML and CSS.

Check back regularly for updated versions to see the progress and just how close we can get.
